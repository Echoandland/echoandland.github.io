## About
I am an undergraduate student at the National University of Singapore (School of Computing).  
My interests lie in reinforcement learning for large language models and LLM reasoning.

## Research Interests
- Reinforcement Learning for Large Language Models (post-training / alignment)
- Reasoning in LLMs (test-time adaptation, multi-agent deliberation)
- AI for Scientific Reasoning

## Latest Publications
- **Collaborative Multi-Agent Test-Time Reinforcement Learning for Reasoning**  
  *arXiv:2601.09667 (2026)* — [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.09667) • [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.09667)

- **Rewarding the Rare: Uniqueness-Aware RL for Creative Problem Solving in LLMs**  
  *arXiv:2601.08763 (2026)* — [arXiv](https://arxiv.org/abs/2601.08763) • [PDF](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2601.08763)
